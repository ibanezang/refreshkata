> What’s a Code Kata?
As a group, software developers don’t practice enough. Most of our learning takes place on the job, which means that most of our mistakes get made there as well. Other creative professions practice: artists carry a sketchpad, musicians play technical pieces, poets constantly rewrite works. In karate, where the aim is to learn to spar or fight, most of a student’s time is spent learning and refining basic moves. The more formal of these exercises are called kata.

> To help developers get the same benefits from practicing, we’re putting together a series of code kata: simple, artificial exercises which let us experiment and learn without the pressure of a production environment. Our suggestions for doing the kata are:
> find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted
> focus on the essential elements of the kata
> remember to look for feedback for every major decision
> if it helps, keep a journal of your progress
> have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the kata first
> There are no right or wrong answers in these kata: the benefit comes from the process, not from the result.

## How does Refreshkata work
If you're familiar with codekata, it will be straight forward. There will be several coding problems will be listed in this repository. The coding problems are sometimes related to algorithm, data structure, and software modelling problems. You can fork this repository and do your exercise in your own fork. It is suggested to revisit the problem to refresh your skill and to see how you have improved overtime.
